    "It is college application season. Across the country four million students will be submitting upwards of forty million applications ([source](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/nyregion/applications-by-the-dozen-as-anxious-students-hedge-college-bets.html)) and then fretting until late March to find the results. Our team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than 13,000 applications to determine which factors matter most to the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. We have also built an [online predictor](http://www.chanceme.info/) that lets a student or parent enter current results, see the chances of getting into an elite college. Even more importantly, the student can then change the values to see if time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity sports.\n",

    "We have provided some much-needed insight into the murky waters of the college admissions process. Our hope is that this information empowers students and their supporters to make informed decisions about priorities and factors to condiser when applying to college. Clearly, SAT scores and GPA are the most important factors of an application. Students should focus on boosting their academic profiles in lieu of joining more and more extracurricular activities.  There are some limitations to our approach given the structure of our dataset. For example, we are unable to take account of any personal statements or recommendation letters, which are obviously very important in the application procedure. However, to the best of our knowledge, this analysis is the most extensive open-source tool available to high school students to date."
